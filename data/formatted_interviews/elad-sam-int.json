You just have to relentlessly say, \u201cThis is what we\u2019re doing, this is why, and this is how we\u2019re going to do it.\u201d And that part\u2014the communication and the evangelizing of the company vision and goals\u2014is time-wise by far the biggest part of the job."

What is the tactical stuff that seems like a waste of time but is important, and what seems important but is a waste of time? For example, I do think figuring out compensation structures is really important and something the CEO should spend time on. And it\u2019s something that most CEOs don\u2019t. You\u2019re building what the company measures and what salespeople get paid for, and that\u2019s one of those counterintuitive areas that I do think is really important. The trick to being effective at this is that you have to get really good at saying no and just not doing things. There are a lot of things that are urgent but not important. The hard part of being a good CEO is that you have to be willing to let some things fall apart. You don\u2019t have enough time to do everything well.

But he was really proud, because for those 74 investors, he responded to every annual audit request. They told him that he was one of the only CEOs that responded right away. He was really proud of this. And I said, \u201cLook, this is a crazy thing. Your company is on fire. You got one not-important tactical thing done while the company is failing, and you feel great about that. All your investors, no matter what they tell you, will be far happier with a big return than you responding to their annual audit request.\u201d And he kind of got it in that moment.

The hard part of getting users and getting revenue is that it means spending your time building stuff and talking to users\u2014and the implication is you should do nothing else.
