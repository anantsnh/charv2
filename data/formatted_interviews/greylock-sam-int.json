I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to keep going. But what I think will happen is there\u2019ll be a whole new set of startups that take an existing very large model of the future and tune it, which is not just fine tuning, all of the things you can do. I think there\u2019ll be a lot of access provided to create the model for medicine or using a computer or a friend or whatever. And then those companies will create a lot of enduring value because they will have a special version of it. They won\u2019t have to have created the base model, but they will have created something they can use just for themselves or share with others that has this unique data flywheel going that improves over time and all of that. So I think there will be a lot of value created in that middle layer."

And those are adding huge amounts of value, and you\u2019re going to be seeing this way more and way more. I think if I had time to do something else, I would be so excited to go after a bio company right now. I think you can just do amazing things there. Anyway, there\u2019s another thing that\u2019s happening, which is tools that just make us all much more productive that help us think of new research directions that write a bunch of our codes so we can be twice as productive. And that impact on the net output of one engineer or scientist, I think, will be the surprising way that AI contributes to science that is outside of the obvious models. But even just seeing now what I think these tools are capable of doing, CoPilot is an example. There\u2019s much cooler stuff than that. That will be a significant change to the way that technological development, scientific development happens. So those are the two that I think are huge now and lead to just an acceleration of progress. I'm a big believer that the only real driver of human progress and economic growth over the long term is the societal structure that enables scientific progress, and then scientific progress itself. But then the big thing that I think people are starting to explore is \u2013 and I hesitate to use this word because I think there\u2019s one way it\u2019s used, which is fine, and one that is more scary \u2013 but AI that can start to be an AI scientist and self-improve. Can we automate our own jobs, as AI developers very first, the very thing we do? Can that help us solve the really hard alignment problems that we don\u2019t know how to solve? That, honestly, I think is how it\u2019s going to happen. The scary version of self-improvement (and the one from the science fiction books) is editing your own code and changing your optimization algorithm and whatever else. But there\u2019s a less scary version of self-improvement, which is what humans do, which is if we try to go off and discover new science, we come up with explanations. We test them. We think. Whatever process we do that is special to humans, teaching AI to do that, I\u2019m very excited to see what that does for the total. I\u2019m a big believer that the only real driver of human progress and economic growth over the long term is the societal structure that enables scientific progress and then scientific progress itself.

And so the alignment problem is: how do we build AGI that does what is in the best interest of humanity? How do we make sure that humanity gets to determine the future of humanity? And how do we avoid both accidental misuse where something goes wrong that we didn\u2019t intend, intentional misuse, where a bad person is using a AGI for great harm, even if that\u2019s what other person wants, and then the inner alignment problems, where what if this thing just becomes a creature that views us as a threat? The way that I think the self-improving systems help us is not necessarily by the nature of self-improvement, but we have some ideas about how to solve the alignment problem at a small scale. And we\u2019ve been able to align OpenAI\u2019s biggest models better than we thought we would at this point. So that\u2019s good. We have some ideas about what to do next, but we cannot honestly look anyone in the eye and say we see out 100 years how we\u2019re going to solve this problem.

But I think there\u2019s so much algorithmic progress to come that we\u2019re going to have a very exciting time. Another thing is I think we will get true multimodal models working. And so not just text and images but every modality you have in one model is able to easily fluidly move between things. I think we will have models that continuously learn. So right now, if you use GPT whatever, it\u2019s stuck in the time that it was trained. And the more you use it, it doesn\u2019t get any better and all of that. I think we\u2019ll get that changed. So I\u2019m very excited about all of that.

We were talking about are there all these people saying, \u201cI\u2019m doing these RL models for fusion or whatever,\u201d and as far as we can tell they\u2019re all much worse than what smart physicists have figured out. I think it is just an area where people are going to say everything is now, \u201cThis plus AI.\u201d Many things will be true. I do think this will be the biggest technological platform of the generation. We like to make predictions where we can be on the frontier, understand predictably what the scaling laws look like (or have already done the research) where we can say, \u201cAll right, this new thing is going to work and make predictions out of that way.\u201d And that\u2019s how we try to run OpenAI, which is to do the next thing in front of us when we have high confidence and take 10% of the company to just totally go off and explore, which has led to huge wins. Oh, I feel bad saying this. I doubt we\u2019ll still be using the transformers in five years. I hope we\u2019re not. I hope we find something way better. But the transformers obviously have been remarkable. So I think it\u2019s important to always look for where I am going to find the next totally new paradigm.

I think you have to assume that\u2019s going to touch almost everything because these seismic shifts that happen when the whole cost structure of society changes, which happened many times before, the temptation is always to underestimate those.

There\u2019s been some promising work in genomics, but stuff on a bench top hasn\u2019t really impacted it. I think that\u2019s going to change. And I think this is one of these areas where there will be these new $100 billion to $1 trillion companies started, and those areas are rare. If you can really make a future of pharma company that is just hundreds of times better than what\u2019s out there today, that\u2019s going to be really different. As you mentioned, there still will be the rate limit of bio has to run at its own thing and human trials take over long they take. So I think an interesting cut of this is, where can you avoid that? The synthetic bio companies that I\u2019ve seen that have been most interesting are the ones that find a way to make the cycle time super fast.

There\u2019s people who say, \u201cWell, it\u2019s going to be the only thing for me to do in 15, 20 years, so of course I\u2019m going to have a big family. That\u2019s what I\u2019m going to spend my time doing. I\u2019ll just raise great kids. And then I think that\u2019s what will bring me fulfillment.\u201d I think, as always, it is a personal decision. I get very depressed when people are like, \u201cI\u2019m not having kids because of AGI.\u201d The EA community is like, \u201cI\u2019m not doing that because they\u2019re all going to die.\u201d The techno-optimists are like, \u201cWell, I want to merge into the AGI and go off exploring the universe. And it\u2019s going to be so wonderful, and I want total freedom.\u201d But I find all of those quite depressing. I think having a lot of kids is great. I want to do that now even more than I did when I was younger. And I\u2019m excited for it."

And then they could do anything that you\u2019d be happy with a remote coworker doing just behind a computer, which includes learning how to go be a doctor, learning how to go be a very competent coder. There\u2019s a lot of stuff that a median human is capable of getting good at. And I think one of the skills of an AGI is not any particular milestone but the meta skill of learning to figure things out and that it can go decide to get good at whatever you need. So for me, that\u2019s AGI. And then super intelligence is when it\u2019s smarter than all of humanity put together."

What is the new social contract? My guess is that the things that we\u2019ll have to figure out are how we think about fairly distributing wealth, access to AGI systems, which will be the commodity of the realm, and governance, how we collectively decide what they can do, what they don\u2019t do, things like that.

I think people worry about that in a little bit of a silly way. I\u2019m sure what people do will be very different, but we always solve this problem.

It\u2019s replacing in some cases, but for the majority of the kind of work that people in these fields want to be doing, it\u2019s enhancing. And I think we\u2019ll see that trend continue for a long time. Eventually, yeah, it probably is just like we look out 100 years, it can do the whole creative job. I think it\u2019s interesting that if you ask people 10 years ago about how AI was going to have an impact, with a lot of confidence from most people, you would\u2019ve heard, first, it\u2019s going to come for the blue collar jobs working in the factories, truck drivers, whatever. Then it will come for the low skill white collar jobs. Then the very high skill, really high IQ white collar jobs, like a programmer or whatever.

Those startups, I think, will be hugely successful and very differentiated startups there.
