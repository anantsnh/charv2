If we just thought this was going to be another tech company, I'd say, \u201cGreat, I know this playbook because I\u2019ve been doing it my whole career, so let's make a really big company.\u201d But if we really, truly get AGI and it breaks, we'll need something different . So I'm very excited for our team and our investors to do super well, but I don't think any one company should own the AI universe out there.

Google does not put these things out for public use. Other research labs don't do it for other reasons; there are some people who fear it\u2019s unsafe. But I really believe we need society to get a feel for this, to wrestle with it, to see the benefits, to understand the downsides.
