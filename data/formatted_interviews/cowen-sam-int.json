We\u2019ve looked at tens of thousands\u200a\u2014\u200awell, in person we\u2019ve maybe looked at 10,000 companies. These personality traits of determination and communication and the ability to articulate a vision for the world and explain how you\u2019re going to get that done\u200a\u2014\u200aI used to think that that was so hard to assess in 10 minutes, it was maybe impossible to try, and YC interviews used to be like an hour. I now think that most of the time, we could get it right in five minutes. When you have enough data points, when you meet enough people and get to watch what they go on to do\u200a\u2014\u200abecause the one thing that\u2019s hard in a 10-minute interview and the most important thing about evaluating someone is their rate of improvement. It\u2019s a little bit hard when you only get a single sample. But when you do this enough times, and you get to learn what to look for, it is incredible how good you can get at that. We will make some mistakes, but on the whole, I think one way that I\u2019d like to see Y Combinator scale is . . . right now, we have maybe, let\u2019s say 25,000 companies per year apply. We only get to meet, say, 2,000 in person. I\u2019m sure we\u2019re making a lot of mistakes there. One thing I\u2019d love to do is to figure out how to meet all 25,000 in person for 10 minutes.

It was not his vision. It was not any of the things that he is well known for, that are all necessary if you want to do what he did in such a short period of time.

The French motto is something like \u201cFreedom, brotherhood, and liberty.\u201d He said he had thought about that for a while. \u201cLiberty, equality, and brotherhood.\u201d He realized that the French people actually didn\u2019t care at all\u200a\u2014\u200aalthough they said it, and that was what it was\u200a\u2014\u200athey didn\u2019t care at all about liberty, and they cared even less about brotherhood.

But the way the world was introduced to nuclear power is an image that no one will ever forget, of a mushroom cloud over Japan. It feels to some people . . . I\u2019ve thought a lot about why the world turned against science, and one answer of many that I am willing to believe is that image, and that we learned that maybe some technology is too powerful for people to have.

You can sequence a human now for a hundred bucks. You can take a sample of your blood, and you can sequence every piece of DNA and RNA in there.

Maybe more physicists should be working on a better plasma physics model so we can get nuclear fusion sooner. Or maybe more physicists should come work at OpenAI because physicists are usually the smartest people. Many people in the field have gotten trapped in various dead ends, and one problem with being really smart is that really smart people tend to be super mimetic, so most physicists I\u2019ve met have the same aspiration, work on the same problem. Maybe it\u2019s just too hard, and there are all these other problems. My advice to all the physicists at Berkeley would be, spend less time thinking about the problem you\u2019re working on today that you\u2019re not making progress on and more time thinking about what problem no other physicist is working on that would be really important to the world and that maybe you can solve."

So let\u2019s say the whole number in the world is 16,000. Every time someone decides they\u2019re going to build the next Y Combinator, the idea is always the following: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be just like Y Combinator, except we\u2019re going to provide free coworking space.\u201d I always want to say to people, \u201cDid you ever think that maybe we thought about that, and it\u2019s a feature, not a bug, that we don\u2019t have it?\u201d I think the single thing that has differentiated YC more than any other decision we\u2019ve made is that we do not have a coworking space. We bring the companies together once a week, but that\u2019s it. It\u2019s enough for a community, but it is enough to build your own identity. Coworking spaces have two big classes of problems. Number one, they are a band-pass filter. Good ideas\u200a\u2014\u200aactually, no, great ideas are fragile. Great ideas are easy to kill. An idea in its larval stage\u200a\u2014\u200aall the best ideas when I first heard them sound bad. And all of us, myself included, are much more affected by what other people think of us and our ideas than we like to admit. If you are just four people in your own door, and you have an idea that sounds bad but is great, you can keep that self-delusion going. If you\u2019re in a coworking space, people laugh at you, and no one wants to be the kid picked last at recess. So you change your idea to something that sounds plausible but is never going to matter. It\u2019s true that coworking spaces do kill off the very worst ideas, but a band-pass filter for startups is a terrible thing because they kill off the best ideas, too. The other thing is the average level of ambition and willingness to work hard at a coworking space is incredibly low. There\u2019s this reversion to the mean that is not what you want in your life."
