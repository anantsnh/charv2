And when you\u2019re nine, doing a card trick or an actual miracle occurring \u2014 there\u2019s gray area between that. The idea that there are things that we don\u2019t understand when we see them and don\u2019t make sense, and as a practicing magician, creating images that gave people the feeling that they were seeing something that they weren\u2019t seeing, it blurred the line for me where reality begins and ends.

And it was a tiny little shop on 99 McDougal. That\u2019s where it was. And it was down a flight of stairs and it was a tiny little basement. Tiny. And I would go there and hear all this European music that I wouldn\u2019t get to hear otherwise, not anything you would hear on the radio or not anywhere that you would hear unless you went to the coolest of nightclubs, you might hear this stuff. And I would hang out there. And they put out some of their own records that turned out to be really influential. And I would ask questions about how it was done. Because I spent so much time in the store, I was friends with the people who worked there. And they walked me through the process of where you could have vinyl pressed and where you could have covers manufactured, and where you could have labels made. And they were all in different places. And I would go from place to place and gather these things and then press up a few hundred copies of my punk rock band\u2019s records. And I did that two times."

So you can feel this energy and express whatever\u2019s going on inside of you through this form. And for young people, who have a lot of energy, it\u2019s a great outlet, because you can channel all of the power of the energy that you have into, let\u2019s say punk rock music, which was the case when I was a kid, or hip-hop music in the case of the things I got to work on.

I mean, the odds that I\u2019d be thinking about something related to this morning. Is that so many of the examples I\u2019m giving are of \u2014 there\u2019s a story and I\u2019m saying maybe that story\u2019s not the right story. There\u2019s a different story. And now I think maybe all there is is stories. And to think about which is the right story is maybe a waste of time. And to enjoy the story that speaks to you. And that\u2019s really all we do anyway. I mean regardless. Do you know what I\u2019m saying? We don\u2019t have to convince anyone of anything. We can just enjoy what we enjoy. And I guess being human is enjoying what we enjoy and sharing what we see."

We\u2019re not \u2014 our creativity doesn\u2019t come from our ideas. All of everything in us comes from somewhere else. And we get to take those elements, and I think I use the word in the book, re-present. We have this information, and we get it, and we get to mix it up and reform it and re-present it back to the world. And sometimes we re-present it back to the world in a way that no one\u2019s seen it before. And it\u2019s exciting. And someone else can see the thing that we share that hadn\u2019t occurred to them before in that form. And that inspires them to make something \u2014 it opens a door in them that allows them to see, oh, it doesn\u2019t have to be the way I thought it was."
