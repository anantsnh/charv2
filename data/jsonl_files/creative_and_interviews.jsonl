And I would hang out there. And they put out some of their own records that turned out to be really influential. And I would ask questions about how it was done. Because I spent so much time in the store, I was friends with the people who worked there. And they walked me through the process of where you could have vinyl pressed and where you could have covers manufactured, and where you could have labels made. And they were all in different places.

So based on that, I realized, okay, we can start having really realistic expectations of ending things once we\u2019ve gone through this process and we\u2019ve done all of the open playing to the point where we have things that we love and we have a vision for the whole thing. And now it\u2019s only a question of the final crafting, editing, and sharing that\u2019s left. If we do that with a schedule, it\u2019s actually helpful to the project.
