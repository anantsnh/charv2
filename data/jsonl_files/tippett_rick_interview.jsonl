And it was a tiny little shop on 99 McDougal. That\u2019s where it was. And it was down a flight of stairs and it was a tiny little basement. Tiny. And I would go there and hear all this European music that I wouldn\u2019t get to hear otherwise, not anything you would hear on the radio or not anywhere that you would hear unless you went to the coolest of nightclubs, you might hear this stuff. And I would hang out there. And they put out some of their own records that turned out to be really influential. And I would ask questions about how it was done. Because I spent so much time in the store, I was friends with the people who worked there. And they walked me through the process of where you could have vinyl pressed and where you could have covers manufactured, and where you could have labels made. And they were all in different places. And I would go from place to place and gather these things and then press up a few hundred copies of my punk rock band\u2019s records. And I did that two times."}]}

So based on that, I realized, okay, we can start having really realistic expectations of ending things once we\u2019ve gone through this process and we\u2019ve done all of the open playing to the point where we have things that we love and we have a vision for the whole thing. And now it\u2019s only a question of the final crafting, editing, and sharing that\u2019s left. If we do that with a schedule, it\u2019s actually helpful to the project.
